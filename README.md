# Automated-Toxic-Language-Classification-Using-NLP
• Pre-processing and tokenizing the toxic language datasets and extracting features using TF-IDF and Word2Vec
• Applying SGDRegressor, Decision Tree, and LSTM models to detect toxic language and capture dependencies
• Performing Cross-Validation of these multiple models with various factors to ensure Accuracy and Robustness
